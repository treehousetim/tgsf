<p>Congratulations!  If you don't see any error messages then you have successfully installed tgsf.</p>

<p>We have worked hard to make tgsf a framework that is useful, robust and easy to use and understand.</p>
<p>Our goal is for you to work with tgsf the same way as you're already working with PHP only with a few time-saving features.</p>
<p>You can visit our <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tgsf/">Google Code</a> project page</a> for more information</p>

<p>There are some simple <?= URL( 'examples' )->anchorTag( 'examples.' ); ?></p>
<p>There is some <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tgsf/wiki/HomePage?tm=6">lame documentation</a></p>
<p>You can use <a href="http://progchat.com/generate/">tgsf Generator</a> to generate code for models, controllers, grids, forms and views</p>

<p>You really should view the document in tgsf_core/legal/bundled.txt</p>
