the datasource object supports many features:

GET()
POST()

are both singleton functions that return datasources.

in order to work with a GET() or POST() datasource, you need to clone it.
this is to prevent a script from overriding them globally.

to get a piece of data from a datasource, use one of these 3 methods:

echo $ds->varname;
echo $ds->getVar( 'varname', 'Default Value' );
echo $ds->_( 'varname', 'Default Value' );
